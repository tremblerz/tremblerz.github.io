        <p>
          Thanks for using Google Maps and Google Earth (<strong>"Google Maps/Google
          Earth"</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Maps/Google Earth allow you to view and use a variety of content, including map
          and terrain data, imagery, business listings, traffic, reviews, and other related
          information provided by Google, its licensors, and users (the
          <strong>"Content"</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing, downloading, or using Google Maps/Google Earth, you are agreeing to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/policies/terms/index.html">Google Terms
          of Service</a> (the <strong>"Universal Terms"</strong>);
          </li>
          <li>these Maps/Google Earth additional terms (the <strong>"Maps/Earth Additional
          Terms"</strong>);
          </li>
          <li>the <a href="/help/legalnotices_maps.html">Google Maps/Google Earth Legal Notices</a>
          (the <strong>"Legal Notices"</strong>); and

          <li>the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/policies/privacy/index.html">Google
          Privacy Policy</a> (the <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Please read each of these four documents carefully, starting with the Universal Terms.
          The Universal Terms clarify, for example, your <a href=
          "https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/policies/terms/#toc-content">intellectual property
          ownership rights in the content you upload</a>, and your responsibilities when using
          Google content or <a href=

          Maps/Google Earth while driving</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collectively, we refer to the Universal Terms, the Maps/Earth Additional Terms, the Legal
          Notices, and the Privacy Policy as the <strong>"Agreement"</strong>. The Agreement is a
          binding contract between you and Google regarding your use of Google Maps/Google Earth.

            <p>
              <strong>License.</strong> Subject to the Agreement's terms, Google grants you a
              non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Google Maps/Google Earth, including
